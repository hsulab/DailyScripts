The DailyScripts Repo is just a collection of scripts I frequently use in my 
daily research. Feel free to download, utilize and modify. Most scripts or 
modules are written in *bash*, *python*, *fortran* and *cpp*.

Theoretical methods used are *DFT*, *DFTB*, *FF*, and *NN*. Computational 
softwares include *GAUSSIAN*, *VASP*, *DFTB*, *LAMMPS*.
